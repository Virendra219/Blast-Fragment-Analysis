# Blast-Fragment-Analysis
<br /> Summer project at IIT(BHU), Varanasi: Develop an application to conduct blast fragment analysis using image processing tools
<br /> form1.cs has the code which works behind the form which the user works with
<br /> It has the code to input an image, apply greyscale filter, Gaussian blur filter, Sobel operator over the image, thin the edges to a width of 1 pixel. 
<br /> The program has functionalities using which the user can draw the missing edges, erase noise, mark shadows and assign unique colours to each rock fragment on.
<br /> The number of pixels of a colour is hashed to its RGB values.
<br /> The real area represented by each pixel is calculated by taking input of a scale from the user and area of each fragment is calculated and blasting efficiency is estimated and output to the user.
